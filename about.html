            <h1>GARAVATO</h1>
            <div class="wrapper">
                <p>My name is Lucia Garavito, I am an 
                    aspiring Interactive Media Designer from Colombia currently living in Canada.
                    The main objective of this personal branding is to display my skills, my artistic view on design and build a solid and consistent brand.</p>
                    <h3>WHY GARAVATO?</h3>
                    <p>In Spanish, GARABATO with B means DOODLE, and my last name is GARAVITO WITH V. I play with these 2 words and the nickname just makes sense. In addition, since I was little I knew my path in life was going to be ART. I was always doodling on my notebooks, on the walls, and even though a doodle does not make sense, I want to show that a well-though well-done doodle goes a long way. A doodle is fun, creative, complicated, simple, intricate. It is versatile, and that is exactly who I am.</p>
                    <p>In this portfolio, I want to show you how I play with colors, how innovative
                     my designs are and appeal to you.</p>
