# portfolio
	**DESCRIPTION**
    I design this portfolio for a college project for UX Design Class. We needed to come up with a personal branding, I decided to create a simple website but that represents me to display all the work and projects that I have been doing for the past years.
    Learning web development has been one of the hardest challenges I have faced in my entire career life. It is complicating and confusing but when you are able to turn some "random" code into an actual design, it all makes sense. 
    I am still struggling understanding the task of each tag, the specificity, what do I have to modify to change the display in the media queries. I still need to understand when to use %, px, em and rem. However, everytime I open Visual Studio Code, I get more familiar with what I have to do.The proffesor and my schoolmates have been a great help and it makes sense that this type of projects are made as a team. I have to be honest, learnig about Bootstrap has been a great relief because it makes coding a little bit simpler.
